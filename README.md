[游대Home](#table-of-content)

AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

### Objective of the Project 
 [游대Home](#table-of-content)
 
The objective of this report is to analyze the performance of AtliQo telecom pre and post the launch of 5G services in May 2022. By comparing key performance indicators (KPIs) between these periods, we aim to provide actionable insights to the management that will enable them to understand the impact of the 5G launch on user engagement, revenue growth, and overall business performance. Additionally, we seek to identify opportunities for optimizing internet plans to attract and retain more active users.

### Problem Statment   
[游대Home](#table-of-content)


AtliQo, a leading telecom provider in India, experienced a decline in active users and revenue growth following the launch of their 5G plans in May 2022. This decline in performance raises concerns for the management regarding the effectiveness of the 5G launch and the overall competitiveness of their internet plans. To address this issue, the management has tasked the analytics team with comparing KPIs before and after the 5G launch to identify areas of improvement and potential strategies for recovery. The challenge lies in understanding the factors contributing to the decline, optimizing internet plans to attract more active users, and making informed decisions to regain momentum in the market.
