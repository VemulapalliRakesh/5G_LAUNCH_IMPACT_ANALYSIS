### About Atliqo
[游대Home](#table-of-content)

AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.

### Objective of the Project 
 [游대Home](#table-of-content)
 
The objective of this report is to analyze the performance of AtliQo telecom pre and post the launch of 5G services in May 2022. By comparing key performance indicators (KPIs) between these periods, we aim to provide actionable insights to the management that will enable them to understand the impact of the 5G launch on user engagement, revenue growth, and overall business performance. Additionally, we seek to identify opportunities for optimizing internet plans to attract and retain more active users.

### Problem Statment   
[游대Home](#table-of-content)


AtliQo, a leading telecom provider in India, experienced a decline in active users and revenue growth following the launch of their 5G plans in May 2022. This decline in performance raises concerns for the management regarding the effectiveness of the 5G launch and the overall competitiveness of their internet plans. To address this issue, the management has tasked the analytics team with comparing KPIs before and after the 5G launch to identify areas of improvement and potential strategies for recovery. The challenge lies in understanding the factors contributing to the decline, optimizing internet plans to attract more active users, and making informed decisions to regain momentum in the market.

After the introduction of 5G, there has been a notable decline in total revenue, accompanied by a surge in the number of unsubscribed users. Additionally, the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) has increased, signaling a clear indication that plan prices may be perceived as too high by consumers. This suggests a need to reassess the pricing strategy of our plans, pinpointing where users might be opting to unsubscribe

#### Revenue:

Among the top contributors to our revenue, the cities of Delhi and Chennai have exhibited a concerning decline following the rollout of 5G technology. This trend highlights a pivotal point of concern, indicating a need for further examination and strategic intervention in these key metropolitan areas.

#### ARPU:

While cities such as Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Patna boast commendable Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), the contrasting factor lies in the increasing number of active users within these urban centers. 

#### Monthly Active users:

Since the launch of 5G, there's been a drop in active users in most cities  It's time to review our pricing and start some marketing campaigns.

#### Monthly Unsubscribed users:

Since the introduction of 5G, there has been a significant increase in the number of unsubscribed users across all cities. Particularly concerning are Lucknow and Pune, where the rate of unsubscribed users exceeds 50%. Addressing this issue is critical to avoid potential negative publicity. 

#### Total Plan Revenue:

![a1](https://github.com/VemulapalliRakesh/5G_LAUNCH_IMPACT_ANALYSIS/blob/main/C3%20Input_for_Participants/plan%20revnue.png)

Plans P1, P2, P3, and the recently introduced P11 collectively contributed to 60% of our revenue. Notably, despite being introduced after the rollout of 5G, P11 has proven to be a significant revenue generator. Among these plans, P1 remains the top performer to date. It's imperative to consider creating more plans akin to P1 and P11, ensuring they strike a balance between value and affordability for our customers.

#### Market share:

Following the launch of 5G, Atliq has experienced a slight negative trend of -0.06% in its shares. In contrast, competitors have demonstrated notable increases in their share values.
